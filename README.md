🌍 PlanetSim

PlanetSim is a planetary simulation game inspired by classic titles like SimEarth, built using C# and MonoGame. The game aims to simulate complex systems such as tectonic activity, climate, life evolution, and civilization development in an interactive, engaging environment.
🎯 Project Goals

  1) Realistic Simulation: Model natural systems like tectonics, climate, and ecosystems.
  2)  Interactive Evolution: Allow players to influence the development of life and civilizations.
  3)  Educational Value: Provide an informative and entertaining way to learn about planetary and biological processes.

🚀 Roadmap

    Phase 1: World and Tectonic Simulation
        Set up a grid-based world representation.
        Implement basic tectonic plates with collision and movement.
        Visualize plate movements and interactions.

    Phase 2: Climate and Atmosphere Systems
        Introduce temperature and weather simulation.
        Implement sun heat and albedo calculations.
        Model basic atmospheric effects.

    Phase 3: Life and Ecosystems
        Create basic life forms and ecosystems.
        Implement evolution mechanics and species adaptation.

    Phase 4: Civilization Development
        Simulate human development, technology, and societal impact on the planet.
        Develop a tech tree and societal evolution system.

    Phase 5: Optimization and UI Improvements
        Optimize performance for complex simulations.
        Develop a user-friendly interface for monitoring and controlling the simulation.
